## Link Script Files

```html
<script src="/dist/RTCMultiConnection.min.js"></script>

<!-- or specific version -->
<script src="RTCMultiConnection.js"></script>

If you're sharing files, you also need to link:

```html
<script src="/dev/FileBufferReader.js"></script>


> You can link multiple files from `dev` directory. Order doesn't matters.
